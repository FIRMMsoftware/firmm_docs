# Framewise Integrated Real-time Motion Monitoring (FIRMM)

Easy to use, the FIRMM software suite provides MRI scanner operators with data quality metrics in real time. Using FIRMM to identify the ideal scan time for each person can reduce total brain MRI scan times and associated costs by 50% or more.
